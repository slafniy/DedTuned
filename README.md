# DedTuned balance mod for Larian's Baldur's Gate 3 (WIP)
The final goals of this mod:
- Make Honor mode slightly harder
- Eliminate as many abuses as possible
- Make too weak abilities stronger
- Make too strong abilities weaker
- Balance out need of resting for different classes
- Remove concentration as much as possible, leave it only for really strong spells
- Add downside of using Illithid Powers because devs forgot to do it :)

## Changelist
### Experience reward
Required XP per level increased (around +27% total) because of two reasons:
- Do not let player to over-level enemies too much
- Bring more sense to XP rewards in Act III (in stock game player reaches level 12 at the beginning of Act III and progress stops)  

Expected levels:
 - 5 at the Act I before Rosymorn Monastery 
 - 6 at the end of Act I
 - 8 at the end of Act II 
 - 12 at the end of Act III
